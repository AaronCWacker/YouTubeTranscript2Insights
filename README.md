# YouTubeTranscript2Insights

This app uses NLP to extract 10 high information words from a transcript then shows digraph models of the word before and after which compose the meaningful sequences.  Here we demonstrate the ability to generalize around the high value information words that form the brain/spinal column of the text by clarifying the features and relationships important to receive the fidelity signal from the core of the long text.

# Generation combining high information sequences:

Using the two markdown outlines combine them and write a new outline with emojis that discusses neuroscience of training assistant LLMs using Pretraining SFT Reward Modeling and RL while explaining the human dimensions and psychology of the context of the two outlines together.  Use the longest continuous sequence as a score to show how well you show intercombinations of the long sequences which have the high information words.  Annotate the high info words in the output text using emojis.


The combined outline aims to integrate the process of developing and training AI models (specifically GPT-based assistants) with the human dimensions of personal growth and self-awareness. By exploring neuroscience, Pretraining SFT (Softmax Temperature), Reward Modeling, and RL (Reinforcement Learning), we can connect both technical and psychological aspects. Here's the outline:
